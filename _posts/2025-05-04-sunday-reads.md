- [I love Maro and I love Harry Styles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D6uCMMhT9w).
- For the last couple of days I've been binge-listening to [Fashion Sucks](https://open.spotify.com/show/5dIgkohzaK2dDc1SxNmICP?si=0cef7c22494f465d). While I've never been particularly into fashion (though I wish I were), I'm fascinated by understanding how industries work from the inside and [cracking their cultural codes](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/12/deconstructing-cultural-codes.html). The hosts, who are fashion industry insiders, bring on Spanish stylists, designers, and other professionals to discuss their work and the nuances of their roles. What I particularly appreciate is how they're addressing an issue they often highlight: the lack of recognition in Spain for those who achieve success internationally. Don't miss their interview with [Alejandro Palomo](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6TJdl1yar0og08qjwFEoZR?si=83b168e51752453b) and [Harry Styles performing As It Was in _that_ iconic Palomo Spain look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1q_91vudlY).
- I have just finished [Nocturno de Chile](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/212412.Nocturno_de_Chile). I started it because [I had never read Bola√±o](https://x.com/nabeelqu/status/1912624020262121728) and a 130-page book seemed like a small investment. The book has felt longer, I guess because it's written as a single continuous paragraph (stream of consciousness-like). 
- I am midway through Ezra Klein's [Abundance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/176444106-abundance). I think this addresses the most important cultural problem of our time: it's not enough to redistribute, we need to build more and better. I hope this gets translated soon.
- [Mistral at Infra @ Scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzT8I-J8sQ8).tl;dw: production is hard.  The real moat isn't model size but operational resilience. You need solid monitoring and automated tests because even a minor GPU driver change can tank latency. Inference infrastructure (rate-limiters, autoscaling, circuit breakers) takes more engineering time than training (this resonates _a lot_). Customer diversity (banks wanting air-gapped clusters, media firms chasing latest checkpoints, multilingual clients needing tokenizer tweaks) means your deployment stack needs to be modular and configurable. That Stanford class is quite good, they had [Guillermo Rauch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqYFxp9yRM&) and [Ben Mann](https://youtu.be/UdxSCFmUk9o?si=iOWaraTLuU28NLb8) before.
- [Javi](https://x.com/javisantana) sent me [this](https://utsavmamoria.substack.com/p/how-to-live-an-intellectually-rich) yesterday. What struck me most about the article was its honest portrayal of the learning process. True learning is inherently painful (yes, [painful](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1756380066580455557)) - it stretches your mind in uncomfortable ways. When mentoring people, there's an instinct to spare others the struggle by sharing everything you've learned (at least I have it), but that would rob them of developing the most crucial skill: the ability to learn and adapt independently. The pain isn't a bug - it's a feature of building mental resilience and resourcefulness. You might need to do [something like this](https://javisantana.com/2021/01/23/echar-a-los-leones.html).
- Last but not least, I've decided to read up on some historical AI papers. The first one is [A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity](https://rbarbadillo.github.io/papers/1943-mcculloch-pitts/). This is just meant to be some of my notes that help me understand what I am reading, just like anything on this blog, I write primarily to understand myself. You can follow along with me [here](https://rbarbadillo.github.io/papers/).
