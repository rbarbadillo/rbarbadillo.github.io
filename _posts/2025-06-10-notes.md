I think that's a good question. Let's break it down:

1. **You**: it's you as in "tú". It's not "vosotros", it's not us. There's a single responsible person. When I was little I always thought of one rule: "if everyone was at least as good as me at X, would the world be better off?" (I later realized I really [disliked Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative)). But I still think there's some truth to this: (a) there are some things only you can do for yourself and your loved ones, (b) even in group things, you need to do your part.

2. **Do**: what matters, 99% of the time, is doing the thing, not talking about the thing. [Revealed preferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference) and how they differ from our stated preferences talk about who we really are.

3. **The important things**: the trickiest part in my opinion. All other things you can get by sheer good will, but this one... Getting *what* are the important things is so difficult. But it is key—"[the main thing is keeping the main thing the main thing](https://kk.org/books/excellent-advice-for-living)". If doing might be becoming easier, this isn't.

4. **Right**: don't half-ass it. Or at least, give it your best.
