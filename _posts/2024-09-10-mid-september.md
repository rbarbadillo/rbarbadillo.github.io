- Some of the [infra challenges](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/06/12/data-infrastructure/training-large-language-models-at-scale-meta/) training Llama. The [storage one](https://youtu.be/S9c27b-jD0c?si=HD4HyPwyGv1ja0nq) is interesting too.
- [Chollet](https://youtu.be/nL9jEy99Nh0?si=cL6Qycgspsdl9ddM). I still fail to see a big qualitative difference between him and AGI-optimists.
- [The importance of ancient texts](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/doom-scrolling/).
- [GDP](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1832588128084730334).
- [Something simple and beautiful to write long messages on](https://blank.page/).
- [On Spanish fashion brands](https://youtu.be/E38FdK0FSP8?si=yhm4luIgtToTy4gl): useful to crack culture codes. I knew [Late Checkout](https://latecheckoutissalifestyle.com/) of course, Shoop ([my best t-shirt](https://www.shoopclothing.com/shoop-ss17-tchaikovsky-tour-tee-front/) is [theirs](https://www.shoopclothing.com/shoop-ss17-tchaikovsky-tour-tee-back/)) and [Sysiphe](https://www.iamsisyphe.com/) (the founder [blogs](https://champan.substack.com/) of course), but it's a good video to get a grasp of all of the scene.
- [Stromae's favorite tracks is what one would expect](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/654sBgqNixQiw3Ctn0S8ro?dlsi=8012bf0fe0cb4274&nd=1).
- The concept of [Elite Human Capital](https://www.richardhanania.com/p/elite-human-capital-is-not-just-iq).
