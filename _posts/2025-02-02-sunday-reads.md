- [AI firms](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/ai-firm).
- [Updating my COVID-origin stance to "most likely zoonosis but honestly don't know really"](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/practically-a-book-review-rootclaim?m)
- [Caring](https://grantslatton.com/nobody-cares) is *the* advantage.
- "[how important doing hard things is to me. It is the heart beat of my life, and I don't 100% understand why, but it probably has something to do with me having not the best childhood](https://vinay.sh/i-am-rich-and-have-no-idea-what-to-do-with-my-life/)."
- [The Vatican on AI.](https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_ddf_doc_20250128_antiqua-et-nova_en.html?utm_source=pocket_shared)
- [Peace and trade.](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/02/peace-and-free-trade.html?utm_source=pocket_saves)
- This week I was in trains a bunch. I worked with no internet which means programming with no Cursor, I realized how used I am to *tabbing*. It was nice having to type it all for a couple hours.
- Also, I am very excited to share what we've been working on at Tinybird. We are [already showing some things](https://x.com/tinybirdco/status/1882096210036830541), and will start officially announcing things in the next few weeks. I think it is the coolest thing I have ever worked on.
- I read some of Ted Chiang's short stories. [One of them is particularly well-known.](https://youtu.be/ZLO4X6UI8OY?feature=shared)
- I enjoyed The Weeknd's [new album](https://open.spotify.com/album/3OxfaVgvTxUTy7276t7SPU?si=jEJ9N0f6QgWTZhe77vq-SQ). I'd start with [these](https://open.spotify.com/track/5673WA8EEUSPx1ir26lhGW?si=a6c26c3606924f43) [three](https://open.spotify.com/track/5ZDKPFRZC6QlJpf8bCIXTs?si=155b6034babc4a07) [tracks](https://open.spotify.com/track/2gyHr9WqZeMtzJOpWGuGo6?si=b45b238b57d245e5). Also, the [Anitta](https://open.spotify.com/track/7DY756WOLyOz2Xnhw4EFiC?si=2d3dc8ca8c2a4f8f) collab slaps.
- [Nabeel's principles](https://nabeelqu.substack.com/p/principles).

> 39. Status is fake and transient. Just focus on substance and doing valuable work. Talk about it in public. Beware the [inner ring fallacy](https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/).
>

That C.S. Lewis speech is the best link in there (and in here too most likely).

> 60. One key to effective negotiation is to have multiple options and be OK with it not working out. Even if you really need the thing, it's never your *only*choice: reframe and create alternative options until you have multiple outcomes you're ok with. (See [BATNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement#Walk-away_BATNA).)
>

I first learned about this in [Getting to yes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_to_Yes). Everyone has an intuition about this.

> 59. There's a lot of alpha in being willing to do "menial" work (take notes, send out agendas, order pizza, manually inspect raw data, whatever). Beware over-delegation and being too far from the details.
>

YES YES YES. So much value. Shows your character too.

> 58. Most intelligent people want status, prestige, wealth and the like -- even the ones who claim not to. "Genius" is a distinct category to intelligence and geniuses are motivated by entirely different things and are socially strange (and often selfish) people. Ayn Rand is a bad writer but is one of the very few people who grokked this and made it explicit.
>

This is both true and an Ayn Rand reference. No commentary needed I just wanted to praise it

> 57. When writing, separate the "creator" and the "editor". The "creator" just writes, and doesn't worry about quality; the goal is words on the page. Later, you can be the "editor" and shape it into something good.
>

True in code too. In fact, you can write, scratch, and rewrite(https://grantslatton.com/software-pathfinding#write-everything-twice).



> 29. Be careful about rationalizing something that does not feel right. (Utilitarians, this means you!)
>

The only reason I get these references and other philosophy ones is because of [this book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/57610167-knowledge-reality-and-value). Michael Huemer is an outstanding writer.
