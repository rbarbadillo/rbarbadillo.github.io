This week I read Byrne Hobart's and Tobias Huber's [Boom: Bubbles and the End of Stagnation](https://press.stripe.com/boom). I started it back when I was in Vietnam but stopped when I came back to Barcelona. I picked it up again this week because the Kindle library reminded me of it, I guess this is the digital parallel of [leaving books laying around at tables](https://youtu.be/zkh3BHP6KJ0?si=sB4K9OBP4o6FggSA&t=406).

I really liked it, it has opened some rabbit-holes:
- [Skunk Works](https://www.freaktakes.com/p/managing-lockheeds-skunk-works)
- Moore's original paper, [Cramming More Components onto Integrated Circuit](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~fussell/courses/cs352h/papers/moore.pdf)
- My favorite: [As we may think](https://worrydream.com/refs/Bush%20-%20As%20We%20May%20Think%20(Life%20Magazine%209-10-1945).pdf) by Vannevar Busch

- ["I felt when I started in February 2000 that I was coming to blogging late. I procrastinated about setting it up. People I knew were already doing it."](https://interconnected.org/home/2025/02/19/reflections) Whoever is reading it, please write your thoughts about stuff somewhere! 
- Listening to [Dwarkesh with Satya Nadella](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Ru9vFJOuYKSHnxABBgAm3?si=b7aa79be0584439f) I thought of two things: [I'm not sure if the relationship between AI growth and GCP growth is that straightforward](https://youtu.be/EM8200Vl7R4?si=dLloJYGRTrEAI3m5&t=433 ) and I think "company man" and “redounded mode” are intertwined, [legitimacy is the constraint](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html).
