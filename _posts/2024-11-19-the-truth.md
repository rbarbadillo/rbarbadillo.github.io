The other day Pau asked Marc and I whether we would like to spend less time working and more time reading. I doubted.

I love reading, I truly do. I’ve done so ever since I can remember. When I was 7 my mum started reading the first Harry Potter book to me and at 8 I read the three other available books and The Lord of the Rings in one fell swoop. At 17 I started reading essays which have been my main thing ever since.
I’ve always been afraid of “just reading” though, being one of those people who talks about things but does not do. Even today, this is one of my biggest impostor’s syndrome paranoias.

And so, as much as I love reading, my work gives me the best tool to face reality and its messiness. 
I start thinking of building something and I think it can fail in X, or Y ways, I build it and in the process I see really Z is the challenge, 
I release it (and if I’m lucky and people use it) find out I had missed 4 different edge cases. 
It’s the best thing to keep you in check from thinking you are entirely right at any point.
