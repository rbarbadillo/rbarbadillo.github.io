[Nabeel recommends honing in the things that make you imbalanced](https://nabeelqu.co/principles).

My own assessment:

- Abnormally high happiness in average, which leads to high levels of energy doing most things. I do them with excitement. (The counter balance is weird spikes of bad moods, but they are rare and the most important outcome of them is people asking if something is wrong because I'm not smiling 100% of the time.)
- I don't get tired of consuming information. Learning about the randomest stuff makes me happy. In fact, I need to limit the time I spend on it actively.
