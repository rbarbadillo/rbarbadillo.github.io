- [Analysis on DeepSeek costs](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/deepseek-v3-and-the-actual-cost-of), [a take on chips](https://x.com/nearcyan/status/1882862342838554821).
- [Thoughts on AI safety](https://windowsontheory.org/2025/01/24/six-thoughts-on-ai-safety/). 
- [The feedback loop of reasoning models capabilities, explained](https://x.com/_LouiePeters/status/1880142612927246460)
- [EpochAI launched a podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zuCe07ibFc)
- [Europe defense struggles](https://www.siliconcontinent.com/p/why-europe-struggles-with-defense) 
- [The reason why Spain does not have good elite selection?](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/01/the-case-for-democracy-from-the-comments.html)
- [Reading the classics](https://miloandthecalf.substack.com/p/why-is-everyone-suddenly-reading). I am currently going through the [Karpathy recommendations](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1865924776214327360) but this made me want to go read Don Quijote, Fuenteovejuna and La Regenta. Middlemarch eventually.
- Some quotes from [Ni Marx, ni Jésus](https://x.com/ktdrozdowski/status/1881756976998502520). The first non-novel I read was a Jean-François Revel book. Yesterday I bought a second-hand version of this one in Spanish. I remain very surprised to see how difficult it is to find some books in Spanish.
- [Shipping code faster](https://www.developing.dev/p/everything-i-know-about-shipping) and [job hopping](https://www.developing.dev/p/when-job-hopping-doesnt-make-sense). 

_Cachitos_ is no more. I think I'll post in this format more regularly. I usually save whatever I want to read using Pocket during the week and read it on Saturday/Sunday morning. I'll post here whatever is good.
