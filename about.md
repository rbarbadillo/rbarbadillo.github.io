Hi! I'm Raquel, a software engineer based in Barcelona. I was born and raised in Cantabria, northern Spain, where I studied Chemical Engineering. After graduating, I moved to Madrid seeking new opportunities and eventually taught myself programming. What started as curiosity turned into a career change that has shaped my professional life since then.

I'm interested in many things, but particularly:

- Software engineering and its intersection with other fields
- Philosophy, especially epistemology and questions of identity
- Music, classical and others
- Reading broadly - from technical papers to essays

I write mostly in Spanish, though occasionally in English. My posts tend to be either personal reflections or collections of interesting things I've found. I believe in the importance of both building things and understanding them deeply - the practical and the theoretical complement each other.
